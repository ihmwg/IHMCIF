### Category relationship diagrams

Category relationship diagrams represent how different data categories in the dictionary
are related through parent-child relationships. For more information, refer to the
documentation on [dictionary organization](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org/docs/tutorials/mechanics/pdbx-mmcif-dict-struct.html).

The category relationship diagrams spanning the different categories in the IHMCIF extension are
provided in the directory "category_relationship_diagrams".
